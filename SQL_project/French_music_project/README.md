# French Music Project
The aim of this project was to create a databse design with a precise topic (French Music in this case) then run queries.

Here is a schema of my databse design:









Here is the questions I answered thanks to my queries:
-Which album has the greatest number of tracks?
-Which albums contain only one genre of music and which type of style?
-Which artists have the greatest number of different styles?
-The top 5 of years selling per Artist
