*The main work of this project was to group the data of the bike path in Paris by arrondissement in order to be able to display the data on a map and to know which arrondissments have the best bike facilities. However, as the size of the arrondissments and the types of cycling facilities are different, it was necessary to make an analysis in 2 distinct parts*
